## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Lucas, a Data Analyst with 4 years of experience, passionate technology, data, games and music!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at Grupo BoticÃ¡rio using Google BigQuery, Tableau, and Python.
- ðŸŒ± My focus at this moment is Data Science and Big Data through my postgraduate specialization at the Federal University of ParanÃ¡, focusing on Python, models, and statistics.

âš¡ **A little more about me:** I'm Brazilian from the south, (obviously) fluent in Portuguese, but also have advanced proficiency in English and Spanish, and I already lived for more than one year in Portugal as a exchange student. Traveling, games, music and sports are my hobbies.
